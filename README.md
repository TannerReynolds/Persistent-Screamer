# Persistent-Screamer
### A fun scary thing to put on your friend's(or foe's) computers

## What is this?
### Persistent Screamer is an annoying cheap jump scare that doesn't go away
### It will not be shown on your task bar, will be hidden from the Alt+Tab menu, will stay fullscreened, will keep turning your volume up and unmuting itself, and will start itself back up again if you try to reboot/re-login to make it stop.

## What is a screamer?
### [This explains what it is](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/internet-screamers)
### Screamers are usually links that look normal, but jump scare those that click on it. This program aims a bit higher than that, with it's purpose being one scare that the user cannot get rid of. If you put this program on the computer of somebody that doesn't know much about computers, expect yourself to be the one removing it later, as no average joe will be able to figure it out.

## But why?
### Because I'm bored.
